\section{Question 3 : Linear structure growth}
Basically, this question is to solve a ODE, we will use 4th order Runge-Kutta method.
Since $\Omega_m$ = 1, the differential equation becomes :
D''+4/(3t)*D' = 2/(3t**2)*D.

In terms of Runge-Kutta, for every iteration, I use a pair of D and D' as an input to calculate D''. Then I will have all information of this present state in order to calculate next state. The pair of D and D' will be updated by R-K method and used
in next iteration.

The fugures show that my results fit with analytical solution very well.
